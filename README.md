## Connecting to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

We will need to connect our project with the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). For an in depth explanation, you can read more about [adding Firebase to your iOS Project.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

### Here's a summary of the steps!

1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new app.
2. Add an iOS app to the project. Make sure the Bundle Identifier - com.glrmeslp.EasyBank you set for this iOS App matches that of the one in this project.
3. Download the GoogleService-Info.plist when prompted.
4. Drag the downloaded GoogleService-Info.plist into the opened project app. In Xcode, you can also add this file to the project by going to File-> Add Files to 'EasyBank' and selecting the downloaded .plist file. Be sure to add the .plist file to the app's main target.
5. At this point, you can build and run the EasyBank!
